# WeatherWeb

This is a website that displays the hourly outside and inside temperature and humidity through charts. The current ouside temperature, temperature feel, humidity, and cloud cover are shown. Also the current indoor temperature and humidity are shown.

This website is to be used with my other two projects [dht22Service](https://github.com/cpitzak/dht22Service) and [weatherService](https://github.com/cpitzak/weatherService).
